Teledoc Challenge in python

I use python to solve the take-home exercise which has the followings requirements:

1. The function should be called addNumbers
2. The function should accept 2 string params
3. Each string param contains M numbers, separated by spaces
4. The function must add the numbers in pairs by "blocks" meaning the first numbers of the first string should add to the first number of the second string
5. The output should be the sums of the pairs, separated by spaces
6. The strings have the same count of numbers
7. The numbers may include decimal places
8. The numbers can be super long like more than 1000+ digits
